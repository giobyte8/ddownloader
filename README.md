# DDownloader | Direct downloader

* Download files through http to your home server
* Manage and monitor downloads through a web UI

## Usage case
Let's say you're on you phone/tablet/laptop and you find out a file that want
to download into your server (Linux distro, Wallpaper, Photo album, Movie, etc),
instead of going to your server and do a `wget` manually you just paste the url
into the **DDownloader** UI and it will take care for you.
